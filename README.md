Customer Segmentation Hierarchical clustering


Results  
The project identifies three main customer segments, based on their purchase frequency, purchase amount, and tenure. The segments are:  

High Spenders: Customers who make large purchases frequently and have been loyal to the company for a long time  
New Customers: Customers who have recently joined the company and made a few purchases, but have the potential to become high spenders  
Low Spenders: Customers who make small purchases infrequently and have been with the company for a short time  
The project suggests several marketing strategies and tactics that could be tailored to each segment, such as:  

Offering exclusive discounts and rewards to high spenders, to reinforce their loyalty and increase their lifetime value  
Providing personalized recommendations and offers to new customers, to encourage them to try new products and increase their purchase frequency  
Simplifying the purchase process and offering incentives to low spenders, to increase their engagement and retention
